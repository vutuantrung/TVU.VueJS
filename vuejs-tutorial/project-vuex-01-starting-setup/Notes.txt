NOTE Instead, Vuex has a built-in concept called MUTATIONS. Mutations are clearly defined methods, which have the logic to update the state.And from inside our components, we should, in the end, just trigger those mutations instead of directly manipulating the state. By triggering mutations, all components that want to edit a state do it in the same way.

NOTE Getters: you could say computer properties defined directly in the store, which we then can use from inside any component of our choice.

NOTE Then you could have one action that dispatches multiple other actions in reaction to different results of HTTP request.

NOTE mapGetters: mapGetters gives you an object, which we now merge into the computed properties object. The object mapGetters will give you is an object full of computed properties, which are defined automatically for you.

NOTE state and context is local in each vuex module. But we can access to the main state by using rootState and rootGeters

NOTE If you add namespace true, you tell vuex that now the entire module and not just the state should be kinda detached from the rest of the store. The name space is this key you assigned for adding the module in the main modules object to your store.
