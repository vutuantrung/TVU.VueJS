NOTE Instead, Vuex has a built-in concept called MUTATIONS. Mutations are clearly defined methods, which have the logic to update the state.And from inside our components, we should, in the end, just trigger those mutations instead of directly manipulating the state. By triggering mutations, all components that want to edit a state do it in the same way.

NOTE Getters: you could say computer properties defined directly in the store, which we then can use from inside any component of our choice.
