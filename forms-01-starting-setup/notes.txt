IMPORTANT NOTE v-model, if the input of type number, the v-model will automatically fetche the input and converts it from a string to a number of data type. By default, if you would be using just JavaScript or if you're using refs and therefore the native JavaScript object representing this input. By default, what's stored in the value is always a string.

NOTE if we have input checkbox, Vue support 2 type: Array(for multi choices) and Boolean(only 1 choice)

NOTE change button type="button" NOT type="submit" to prevent submit all the form

IMPORTANT NOTE v-model is a short cut of listen to the input event and binding the value atrribute (@input="" :value="")
